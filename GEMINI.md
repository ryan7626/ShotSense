## Project Overview

This project, "ShotSense," is an iOS application designed to provide intelligent photo composition guidance using on-device AI. It analyzes the live camera feed to detect subjects and provides real-time feedback based on composition rules.

The application is built with Swift, SwiftUI, and CoreML. It leverages the Vision, AVFoundation, and CoreImage frameworks. The architecture is modular, consisting of a Camera Engine, an AI Analyzer, and a Feedback Layer.

## Building and Running

### Requirements

*   macOS with Xcode 15+
*   iOS 17+ target
*   Swift 5.9+

### Build Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open the `ShotSense.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.

**Note:** The `ShotSense.xcodeproj` file is mentioned in the `README.md` but does not currently exist in the project structure.

## Development Conventions

The project uses Git for version control, and the development environment is Xcode. The `README.md` suggests a modular architecture, and development should likely follow this pattern. The core technologies are Swift and SwiftUI, so development should adhere to the conventions and best practices for these technologies.
